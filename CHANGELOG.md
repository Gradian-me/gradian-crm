## [2025-09-04 14:10:00] - Bug Fix: Implement True Funnel Shape with Stepped Widths on Large Screens
Date and Time of changes: 2025-09-04 14:10:00
Detailed description of changes: Fixed the funnel visualization to display proper stepped/funnel shape on large screens where each stage gets progressively narrower, while maintaining optimal width on mobile devices. Implemented responsive width system using CSS custom properties with different width calculations for mobile and desktop. On mobile, stages maintain minimal stepping (85-95% width) for better readability, while on large screens (lg breakpoint), stages show pronounced funnel shape with 12% width reduction per stage (100%, 88%, 76%, 64%, 52%, 55%, 55%). Added CSS media query in globals.css to handle responsive width transitions using CSS custom properties. Enhanced visual hierarchy and improved funnel metaphor representation while maintaining accessibility across all device sizes.
Components affected:
- app/sales/page.tsx (implemented responsive width calculation system with separate mobile and desktop width variables, added CSS custom properties for responsive width control, enhanced funnel stage className with unique identifiers)
- app/globals.css (added responsive funnel width CSS media query for large screens, implemented CSS custom property-based width control system)
